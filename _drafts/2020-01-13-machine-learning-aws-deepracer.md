Machine Learning with AWS Deepracer

AWS Deepracer is...

We work with ML, and I understand their infrastructure, but they are really doing their own thing. I've seen a few of their presentations, and I've checked out a few presentations online. Although I was able to read english about it, there was no wehre for me to play with Machine Learning. Was I supposed to learn Tensorflow, python, and a bunch a math? It was super unclear where to start or how to do it. Deepracer makes it really easy to dive into machine learning. You can do it a little or a lot.



Deepracaer has the ability to dig deeper. My simulation used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Minorize Maximize algorithm (MM). I found out more about that here: https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-proximal-policy-optimization-ppo-explained-77f014ec3f12

I took from others online here and here.

I'd love to hear how others are doing this. Email or comment below.
