Hello, my name is Scott Eissfeldt

### facts about me

- worked in a BBQ pit for a summer in high school
- rode my bicycle from Seattle to Portland (208 miles) in one day
- served two, three year terms on [Multnomah County Budget Advisory Committee](http://multnomah.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=3&clip_id=418&meta_id=25955)


To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
